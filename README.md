Example CI/CD pipeline showing how to deploy Knime to elestio.

This comes with several softwares pre-installed:

- Chrome
- Wine (Windows compatibility, you can install/run any windows program)

All the data is persisted in ./data on the host.

Audio is working as well! (thanks to PulseAudio + ffmpeg + jsmpeg + websockets)
